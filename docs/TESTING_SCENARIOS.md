## 1. Table Image Extraction

**Status**: ‚úÖ Tested & Working  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Last Tested**: October 16, 2025

### Description
Tables with embedded images (diagrams, flowcharts, state models) require special handling because Notion table cells cannot contain images. Images are extracted from table cells and placed as separate image blocks after the table, with placeholder text in the cells.

### Test URL
```
https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/yokohama-it-service-management/page/product/change-management/concept/normal-standard-emergency-states.html
```

### Expected Behavior
- [ ] Images in table cells are preserved (not replaced with bullets)
- [ ] Table cells show placeholder text: "See 'Figure N. Caption text'"
- [ ] Images appear as separate blocks immediately after the table
- [ ] Image blocks have captions matching the placeholder text
- [ ] Images are at the same nesting level as the table (not indented)
- [ ] Multiple tables with images are handled correctly

### What to Look For
**In Notion:**
- Table cells contain readable "See 'Figure X...'" text
- Images appear below tables with proper captions
- Images are not missing or duplicated

**In Server Logs:**
- `üîß Replacing figures with placeholders in table HTML...`
- `üì∏ Extracting images from table HTML...`
- `‚úÖ Added image block with caption: "Figure N..."`

### Test Variations
- [ ] Single table with single image
- [ ] Single table with multiple images
- [ ] Multiple tables each with images
- [ ] Table with rowspan/colspan containing images
- [ ] Nested tables with images (edge case)

### Related Files
- `src/content/content-extractor.js` (lines 192-225, 313-341, 677-692)
- `server/services/servicenow.cjs` (lines 621-680)
- `docs/table-image-extraction.md` (full documentation)
- `docs/testing-table-images.md` (detailed testing guide)

## 2. Rich Text 100-Element Limit

**Status**: ‚úÖ Tested & Working  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Last Tested**: October 13, 2025

### Description
Notion's API limits rich_text arrays to 100 elements per block. ServiceNow pages with heavy inline formatting (code blocks, links, bold/italic) can easily exceed this limit. Content is automatically split into multiple consecutive blocks.

### Test URL
```
https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/yokohama-platform-administration/page/administer/navigation-and-ui/concept/c_CustomizingUIPages.html
```
*(Any page with heavy inline code formatting and many links)*

### Expected Behavior
- [ ] Pages with >100 rich text elements don't cause API errors
- [ ] Content is split into multiple consecutive blocks
- [ ] Formatting is preserved across block boundaries
- [ ] Split is invisible to end user (reads naturally)
- [ ] No content is lost or duplicated

### What to Look For
**In Notion:**
- Long paragraphs with heavy formatting appear complete
- Content flows naturally (no awkward breaks)
- Formatting (bold, italic, code, links) preserved throughout

**In Server Logs:**
- `üîç Rich text has X elements, splitting into Y chunks`
- `‚úÖ Added paragraph block (chunk N/Y)`

### Test Variations
- [ ] Paragraph with 100+ inline code blocks
- [ ] Paragraph with 100+ links
- [ ] Heading with 100+ formatted elements
- [ ] List item with 100+ elements
- [ ] Callout with 100+ elements

### Related Files
- `server/services/servicenow.cjs` (splitRichTextArray function, lines ~450-470)
- `docs/fix-rich-text-100-element-limit.md` (full documentation)

```
‚úÖ **Tested October 16, 2025** - JavaScript code blocks with language detection, code blocks nested in list items

### Expected Behavior
- [ ] Code blocks preserve exact whitespace and indentation
- [ ] Line breaks are maintained (not collapsed)
- [ ] HTML entities are decoded (`&lt;` ‚Üí `<`, `&amp;` ‚Üí `&`)
- [ ] Language is detected from class (e.g., `language-javascript`)
- [ ] Language is normalized for Notion (e.g., `js` ‚Üí `javascript`)
- [ ] Unknown languages default to "plain text"

### What to Look For
**In Notion:**
- Code blocks appear with proper formatting
- Syntax highlighting is applied when language detected
- Indentation matches original ServiceNow page

**In Server Logs:**
- `üîç Found pre/code element`
- `üîç Detected language from class: javascript`

### What to Look For
**In Notion:**
- Nested lists appear indented correctly
- List numbering is sequential
- Mixed content (text + nested lists) works

**In Server Logs:**
- `üîç Processing bulleted_list_item`
- `üîç Processing nested list (ul/ol)`
- `üîç Creating bulleted_list_item with X valid children`
- `üîç Added marker (sn2n:XXX) for N deferred blocks`

### Test Variations
- [ ] Bulleted list with nested bulleted list
- [ ] Numbered list with nested numbered list
- [ ] Bulleted list with nested numbered list
- [ ] Numbered list with nested bulleted list

## 8. Div/Section Container Handling

**Status**: ‚úÖ Tested & Working  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Last Tested**: October 16, 2025

### Description
ServiceNow pages use many `<div>` and `<section>` containers for layout. These must be processed recursively while avoiding unnecessary nesting in Notion.

### Test URLs
Any complex ServiceNow documentation page.

```
https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-it-service-management/page/product/it-service-management/reference/customize-script-includes-itsm.html
```
‚úÖ **Tested October 16, 2025** - Mixed content (text + nested blocks), `<div class="p">` with nested `<ul>` and `<pre>` elements

```
https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-it-service-management/page/product/it-service-management/reference/r_ITServiceManagement.html
```
‚úÖ **Tested October 16, 2025** - Extremely complex nested structure:
- 86 blocks from deeply nested HTML (31,563 characters)
- 12 top-level sections with multiple children each (1-7 children per section)
- Deep container hierarchy: div.zDocsTopicPageBodyContent > div.none > article.hascomments > main.none > article.overview.dita > div.body.refbody
- Special containers: `table-wrap`, `contentPlaceholder`, `contentContainer zDocsSideBoxes withExpandCollapse`, `contentWrapper`
- Mixed content throughout (text + nested figures, lists, divs)

### Expected Behavior
- [ ] Container divs processed recursively
- [ ] Layout containers don't create empty blocks
- [ ] Content extraction flattens unnecessary nesting
- [ ] Special classes trigger custom handling (e.g., `note`, `prereq`)
- [ ] Deeply nested content doesn't hit recursion limits

### What to Look For
**In Notion:**
- Clean content structure (not overly nested)
- No empty blocks or gaps
- Logical content flow

**In Server Logs:**
- `üîç Processing div/section container`
- `üîç Processing N children`
- `üîç Container processed as [handling type]`

### Test Variations
- [ ] Simple divs with paragraphs
- [ ] Nested divs (3+ levels)
- [ ] Divs with mixed content (text, lists, images)
- [ ] Sections with special classes
- [ ] Empty containers (should be skipped)

### Related Files
- `server/services/servicenow.cjs` (container handling throughout)
