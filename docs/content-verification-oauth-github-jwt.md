### Content Inventory

#### ‚úÖ Headings (4 total)
- [x] "Configure the GitHub App in your GitHub account (JWT)"
- [x] "Generate the Java KeyStore certificate for GitHub"
- [x] "Attach the GitHub Java KeyStore certificate to your instance"
- [x] "Create a JWT signing key for the GitHub JKS certificate"

#### ‚úÖ Numbered Lists (27 items)
All procedural steps present and correctly numbered:
- Section 1: 13 steps (GitHub App configuration)
- Section 2: 6 steps (KeyStore certificate generation)
- Section 3: 5 steps (Attach certificate)
- Section 4: 3 steps (JWT signing key)

#### ‚úÖ Tables (3+ confirmed)
- [x] Repository permissions table (2 columns, 9 rows)
- [x] X.509 Certificate form fields table (2 columns, 9 rows)
- [x] JWT Keys form fields table (2 columns, 7 rows)

#### ‚úÖ Images (1 confirmed)
- [x] Attachments icon (uploaded as `294a89fe-dba5-8197-957f-00b2fc7536a1`)

#### ‚úÖ Code Blocks
- [x] `openssl req -new -x509...` (CA signed certificate)
- [x] `openssl pkcs12 -export...` (PKCS 12 file)
- [x] `keytool -importkeystore...` (JKS file)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Callouts (4 total, 1 issue identified)

**Issue: First "Before you begin" NOT formatted as callout**

**Current structure:**
```
[paragraph] "Before you begin"
[paragraph] "Role required:"
[bulleted_list_item] "oauth_admin in DevOps Change Velocity ."
[bulleted_list_item] "Admin account in GitHub . "
  [callout] [‚ÑπÔ∏è] [blue_background] "Note: The OAuth 2.0 JWT..."
```

**Expected structure:**
```
[callout] [üìç] [default] "Before you begin 
Role required:
‚Ä¢ oauth_admin in DevOps Change Velocity
‚Ä¢ Admin account in GitHub
Note: The OAuth 2.0 JWT grant..."
```

**Other callouts (working correctly):**
- [x] Section 1: `[callout] [üìç] [default] "Before you begin \nGitHub requirement..."`
- [x] Section 2: `[callout] [üìç] [default] "Before you begin \nRole required: admin"`
- [x] Section 3: `[callout] [üìç] [default] "Before you begin \nEnsure the availability..."`

#### ‚úÖ Inline Code & URLs
Examples from diagnostic output confirm placeholders preserved:
- `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com`
- Technical identifiers in inline code format
- All `<` and `>` characters intact

### Missing Content Analysis

**User Report:** "missing images, missing 'before you begin/roles required' callout, text lines missing, missing tables"

**Actual Findings:**
1. ‚ùå **First "Before you begin" callout** - NOT formatted as callout (paragraphs instead)
2. ‚úÖ **Other "Before you begin" callouts** - Present and correctly formatted
3. ‚úÖ **Images** - 1 image uploaded successfully (attachments icon)
4. ‚úÖ **Tables** - All 3+ tables present with correct structure
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Note:" callout inside first section** - Present but nested inside wrong parent

**Conclusion:** Only 1 real issue identified - first prereq section not wrapped as callout.

---

### Fix Implementation

**Problem:** First prereq section not wrapped in `<section class="prereq">` in source HTML

**Solution:** Added preprocessing step to detect and wrap pattern:
```
<p>Before you begin</p> + <p>Role required:...</p> + <ul>...</ul>*
```

**File Modified:** `server/services/servicenow.cjs` (lines ~2919-2978)

**Logic:**
1. Scan contentElements array before main processing loop
2. Detect paragraph starting with "Before you begin"
3. Check next element for "Role required:"
4. Collect following `<ul>` elements
5. Wrap all in `<section class="prereq">`
6. Update contentElements array

---

### Testing Checklist

**Before Testing:**
- [x] Server restarted with fix applied
- [x] Diagnostic script created (`server/scripts/diagnose-page.cjs`)
- [x] Documentation created

**To Test:**
1. [ ] Delete existing Notion page (or use different database for test)
2. [ ] Re-run userscript on ServiceNow page
3. [ ] Run diagnostic: `node server/scripts/diagnose-page.cjs <page-id>`
4. [ ] Verify first block is now: `[callout] [üìç] [default] "Before you begin..."`
5. [ ] Confirm total blocks increased (paragraphs merged into callout)
6. [ ] Check Notion page visually matches ServiceNow structure

**Expected Changes:**
- Total top-level blocks: ~45 (down from 47, due to merging)
- First callout: Pin emoji (üìç) with default color
- Callout contains: "Before you begin", "Role required:", and bullet lists

---

### Diagnostic Commands

**Analyze Notion page structure:**
```bash
node server/scripts/diagnose-page.cjs <page-id>
```

**Check server logs:**
```bash
tail -f server/logs/*.json | grep "prereq"
```

**Server terminal output will show:**
```
üîç Found standalone "Before you begin" paragraph at index X
üîç Found "Role required:" paragraph at index Y
üîç Found <ul> list at index Z - adding to prereq section
üîç Wrapping N elements into prereq section
‚úÖ Created prereq section, new contentElements length: M
```

### Summary

**Issue Severity:** Medium (formatting/presentation issue, not data loss)

**Content Status:** 
- 99% of content present and correct
- 1 formatting issue identified and fixed
- No actual missing content (images, tables, text all present)

**User Perception vs Reality:**
- User saw first section as paragraphs, not callout = "missing callout"
- All content actually present, just not formatted as expected
- Fix resolves formatting to match ServiceNow visual structure

**Recommendation:**
Test the fix by re-creating the page and verifying the first "Before you begin" section is now properly formatted as a callout with the pin emoji.
