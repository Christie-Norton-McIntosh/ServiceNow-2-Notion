## 🗂️ Files Archived

All obsolete files have been moved to `backups/modularization-cleanup-20251013/`:

### Obsolete Development Files:
- **Server backup files**: `sn2n-proxy.cjs.*backup*`
- **Debug tools**: `snippet-test.cjs`, `debug-structure.cjs`, `create-minimal-test.cjs`
- **Test utilities**: `dump-blocks.cjs`, `run-orchestrator.cjs`
- **Sample data**: `sample*.html`, `sample.json`, `test-*.html`
- **Old logs**: Various server and debug logs
- **Debug artifacts**: orchestrator-result.json, parsed-blocks.json, etc.

### Log Cleanup:
- Moved logs older than 24 hours to archive
- Kept recent debug logs for active development
- Reduced `server/logs/` from 200+ files to ~90 recent files

## ✨ Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Cleaner Structure**: Removed 50+ obsolete files from active workspace
2. **Better Navigation**: Clear separation between production code and archives
3. **Reduced Clutter**: Easier to find and work with current files
4. **Preserved History**: All cleaned files archived with documentation for recovery
5. **Improved Performance**: Faster file searches and reduced IDE overhead

## 🔄 Recovery Process

If any archived files are needed, they can be restored from:
- `backups/modularization-cleanup-20251013/`
- See the README.md in that directory for detailed file manifest

## 📋 Production-Ready Structure

The project now has a clean, maintainable structure optimized for:
- ✅ Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- ✅ Clean development workspace
- ✅ Archived obsolete files for safety
- ✅ Optimized for production deployment and future development

**The ServiceNow-2-Notion project is now fully modularized, documented, and cleaned up!**
