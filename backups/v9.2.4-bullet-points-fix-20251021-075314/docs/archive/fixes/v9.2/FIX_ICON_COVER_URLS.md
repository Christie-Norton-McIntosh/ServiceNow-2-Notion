# Fix: Icon and Cover Images Not Visible on Notion Pages

## Problem
Page icons and cover images were not appearing on newly created Notion pages. The pages were being created successfully, but the icon and cover images were broken/missing.

## Root Cause
The GitHub raw URLs for the icon and cover images had an **incorrect path** with a duplicate folder name:

**Incorrect URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/ServiceNow-2-Notion/src/img/ServiceNow%20icon.png
                                                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                                                          Duplicate folder name
```

This resulted in a **404 Not Found** error when Notion tried to fetch the images.

## Solution
Removed the duplicate `ServiceNow-2-Notion/` folder name from both URLs:

**Corrected URLs:**
```
Icon:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/src/img/ServiceNow%20icon.png
Cover: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/src/img/ServiceNow%20cover.png
```

Both URLs now return **200 OK** ✅

## What Changed
**File:** `server/routes/w2n.cjs` (lines 411 and 417)

### Before:
```javascript
icon: {
  type: "external",
  external: {
    url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/ServiceNow-2-Notion/src/img/ServiceNow%20icon.png",
  },
},
cover: {
  type: "external",
  external: {
    url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/ServiceNow-2-Notion/src/img/ServiceNow%20cover.png",
  },
},
```

### After:
```javascript
icon: {
  type: "external",
  external: {
    url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/src/img/ServiceNow%20icon.png",
  },
},
cover: {
  type: "external",
  external: {
    url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/src/img/ServiceNow%20cover.png",
  },
},
```

## Verification
Tested both URLs with curl:
```bash
# Icon URL
curl -I "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/src/img/ServiceNow%20icon.png"
# Result: HTTP/2 200 ✅

# Cover URL
curl -I "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christie-Norton-McIntosh/ServiceNow-2-Notion/main/src/img/ServiceNow%20cover.png"
# Result: HTTP/2 200 ✅
```

## Server Restart
The server was restarted to apply the changes:
```bash
kill <pid> && npm start
```

Server status: ✅ Running on port 3004

## Expected Results
After this fix:
- ✅ Page icons will appear with the ServiceNow icon
- ✅ Page covers will appear with the ServiceNow cover image
- ✅ No more broken/missing images on new pages
- ✅ Existing pages are unaffected (they already have broken URLs, but can be manually updated in Notion if desired)

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Create a new page using the ServiceNow-2-Notion tool
2. Check that the page icon appears (ServiceNow logo)
3. Check that the page cover appears (ServiceNow banner)
4. Both should load without errors

## Notes
- The actual image files are located at: `src/img/ServiceNow icon.png` and `src/img/ServiceNow cover.png`
- GitHub's raw.githubusercontent.com service provides direct access to files in the repository
- URL encoding: Spaces are encoded as `%20` in URLs
- The fix only affects **new pages** created after the server restart
- Existing pages with broken images can be manually updated in Notion if needed

## Files Modified
- `server/routes/w2n.cjs` (lines 411, 417)

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Fix applied
- ✅ Server restarted
- ✅ URLs verified working
- ✅ Ready for testing
