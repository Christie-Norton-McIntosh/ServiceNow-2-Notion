# Modularization Cleanup Archive - October 13, 2025

This directory contains files that were archived during the project cleanup after completing the modular architecture refactoring.

## Files Archived:

### Server Backup Files:
- `sn2n-proxy.cjs.backup-before-syntax-fix`
- `sn2n-proxy.cjs.v8.1.0.backup`
- `sn2n-proxy.cjs.v8.2.5.backup`

### Debug/Test Files:
- `snippet-test.cjs` - Code snippet testing utility
- `debug-structure.cjs` - Structure debugging tool
- `create-minimal-test.cjs` - Minimal test case creator
- `dump-blocks.cjs` - Block dumping utility
- `run-orchestrator.cjs` - Orchestration testing tool

### Sample/Test Data:
- `sample*.html` - Sample HTML test files
- `sample.json` - Sample JSON data
- `tmp_payload.json` - Temporary payload data
- `test-*.html` - Test HTML files

### Log Files:
- `server.log` - Old server logs
- `server_output.log` - Server output logs
- `server_test.log` - Server test logs
- `sn2n-proxy.out` - Proxy output logs
- Various debug and orchestration JSON files
- Old notion-payload JSON files (>7 days old)

## Cleanup Rationale:

These files were moved during the transition from monolithic to modular architecture:

1. **Backup files** are no longer needed as the modular architecture is stable
2. **Debug/test files** are development utilities not needed in production
3. **Sample files** were used during development but are no longer required
4. **Old logs** have been archived to keep the workspace clean

## Recovery:

If any of these files are needed, they can be restored from this archive directory.
