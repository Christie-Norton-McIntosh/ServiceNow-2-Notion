# Release Notes - Version 9.2.4

**Release Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Release Type:** Bug Fix (Patch)  
**Previous Version:** 9.2.3

---

## üéØ Overview

Version 9.2.4 fixes a critical formatting issue where bullet points in ServiceNow table cells were appearing on the same line instead of separate lines in Notion pages.

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

### Bullet Points on Separate Lines in Table Cells

**Problem:**
```
Before: ‚Ä¢ Item 1‚Ä¢ Item 2‚Ä¢ Item 3
After:  ‚Ä¢ Item 1
        ‚Ä¢ Item 2
        ‚Ä¢ Item 3
```

**Root Cause:**  
The text splitting logic in `rich-text.cjs` was skipping empty lines, which inadvertently removed leading newlines from text segments. This caused bullet points to run together.

**Solution:**  
Modified the text processing to preserve all newlines, including those that appear as empty lines after splitting. The fix ensures that every newline in the source content creates a corresponding newline element in the Notion rich_text format.

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Bullet lists in table cells now render correctly
- ‚úÖ Multi-line content in tables preserves proper line breaks
- ‚úÖ No regression in other content types

- Userscript reload required

### From v9.2.2 or Earlier
- All improvements from v9.2.3 included
- Review span tag fixes in v9.2.3 notes

---

## üêõ Known Issues

None at this time.

## üéì Technical Details

### Why the Old Code Failed

The original implementation:
```javascript
if (!line.trim() && i < lines.length - 1) {
  continue;  // Skip empty lines
}
```

This was intended to clean up extra whitespace from HTML formatting. However, when text like `"\n‚Ä¢ Item1"` was split, it created `["", "‚Ä¢ Item1"]`. Skipping the empty first element meant the leading newline was lost.

### Why the New Code Works

The fix:
```javascript
// Don't skip any lines - they all matter for newline positioning
if (line.trim()) {
  richText.push({ type: "text", text: { content: line }, ... });
}

// Always add newlines between lines (preserves structure)
if (i < lines.length - 1) {
  richText.push({ type: "text", text: { content: '\n' }, ... });
}
```

By processing all lines (including empty ones) and always inserting newline elements, we preserve the exact structure from the source HTML.

## üìä Performance Impact

- **API Calls:** No change
- **Memory:** Negligible (few extra rich_text elements)
- **Processing Time:** No measurable difference
- **Server Load:** No impact

---

## üîô Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
# Option 1: Git revert
git checkout v9.2.3
npm install
npm run build

# Option 2: Use backup
cp backups/v9.2.3-*/server/converters/*.cjs server/converters/
npm run build
```

---

## üìù Breaking Changes

None. This is a backward-compatible bug fix.

---

## üîÆ What's Next

Future improvements being considered:
- Additional table cell formatting options
- Enhanced list nesting support
- Improved code block handling

---

## üôè Acknowledgments

Thanks to the user for thorough testing and providing multiple test cases that helped identify the root cause.

## üìö Additional Resources

- **Fix Documentation:** `docs/fix-bullet-points-newlines.md`
- **Full Backup:** `backups/v9.2.4-bullet-points-fix-20251021-075314/`
- **Previous Release:** v9.2.3 (HTML span tag fixes)

## ‚ú® Summary

Version 9.2.4 completes the table cell formatting fixes started in v9.2.3, ensuring that both HTML tags are properly stripped AND bullet points render on separate lines. ServiceNow table content now converts cleanly to Notion with proper formatting preserved.

**Recommended Action:** Update to v9.2.4 for proper table cell formatting.
