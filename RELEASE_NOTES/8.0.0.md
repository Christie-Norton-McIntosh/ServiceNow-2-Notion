# Release 8.0.0 — ServiceNow-2-Notion

Release date: 2025-10-03 (local)

Summary
-------
This release focuses on robust image handling (especially ServiceNow-hosted images), table compatibility with Notion, and stability improvements to the HTML-to-Notion conversion pipeline.

Highlights
----------
- Images
  - Full download-and-upload flow for images: the proxy now downloads images (supporting authenticated ServiceNow-hosted images) and uploads them to Notion using the Notion file upload flow.
  - Inline images in paragraphs are preserved and positioned correctly in the Notion page flow (image-only paragraphs no longer get dropped).
  - Disabled Martian conversion bypass for HTML-to-Notion conversion to ensure custom image handling is used.

- Tables
  - Userscript now replaces images and SVGs inside `<table>` markup with a bullet symbol (•) before sending HTML to the proxy; Notion does not support images in table cells, so bullets act as placeholders.
  - Server-side table parsing (`parseTableToNotionBlock`) inspects `<thead>` vs `<tbody>` and uses the first tbody row to decide whether to treat the row as a header (if the first tbody row contains images, header row is disabled).

- Conversion
  - Improved HTML parsing and extraction logic; removed earlier behavior that extracted all images at the top of the page (which caused images to appear above content).
  - Added robust logging and SN2N_VERBOSE flag for verbose troubleshooting.

- Build & Distribution
  - Bumped package version to `8.0.0` and rebuilt `dist/ServiceNow-2-Notion.user.js` with updated metadata.
  - Created a timestamped backup of key files in `backups/8.0.0-<timestamp>/`.

Files Changed
-------------
- `package.json` — version bumped to `8.0.0`
- `src/config.js` — `PROVIDER_VERSION` set to `8.0.0`
- `src/content/content-extractor.js` — added table image/SVG replacement and logging
- `server/sn2n-proxy.cjs` — improved image download/upload flow and paragraph image handling
- `dist/ServiceNow-2-Notion.user.js` — rebuilt userscript with updated metadata

Notes & Next Steps
------------------
- Consider tagging the release and creating a GitHub release entry with the release notes below.
- If you want the userscript header to carry a longer changelog or a CHANGELOG.md file, I can add one.
- I did not change any behavior that would affect backward compatibility for saved user settings.

Acknowledgements
----------------
Thanks for the detailed debugging logs and sample pages — they made tracking the image stripping easy.
