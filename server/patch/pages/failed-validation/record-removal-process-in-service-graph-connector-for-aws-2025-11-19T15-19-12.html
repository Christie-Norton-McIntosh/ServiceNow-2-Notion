  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The <span class="ph">Service Graph Connector for AWS</span> uses the optimized deletion approach to manage removal of records.</p>
    <p class="p">Record removal is the process of handling data that is no longer needed. For any discovered resources deleted later after pulling data, the <span class="ph">Service Graph Connector for AWS</span> automatically updates the <span class="ph uicontrol">Install Status</span> field of the associated <span class="ph">CMDB</span> CI classes to indicate any retired or deleted records.</p>
    <p class="p">Deletion of records in <span class="ph">Service Graph Connector for AWS</span> involves marking the install status of a record as <span class="ph uicontrol">retired</span> rather than permanently deleting it from the system. The record remains in the database, making it possible to reference
      or restore it later. Deletion for <span class="ph">Service Graph Connector for AWS</span> relies on the Source [sys_object_source table], which can become inefficient with large datasets.</p>
    <p class="p">To enhance the deletion process, you can enable the optimized deletion method that leverages the SG-AWS Extension Attributes [sn_aws_extension_attributes] table. This table is regularly purged of obsolete records, improving
      performance and efficiency. The process still marks the install status of a record as <span class="ph uicontrol">retired</span> but the streamlined data structure reduces overhead, ensuring quicker processing and better system performance.
