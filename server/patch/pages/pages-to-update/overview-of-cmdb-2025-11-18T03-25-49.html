  configurations your network infrastructure needs to support a <span class="ph">ServiceNow</span> service.</p>

      <section class="section">
         <p class="p">In CMDB, the logical service configurations are mapped to the physical layout data of the supporting network and application infrastructure in each of your respective domains. They track the physical and logical state of IT
            service elements and associate incidents to the state of service elements, which helps in analyzing trends and reducing problems and incidents.</p>
         <p class="p">The configurations are stored in a configuration management database (<span class="ph">ServiceNow</span> CMDB) which consists of entities,
    called Configuration Items (CI), that are part of your environment. A CI may be:</p>
         <ul class="ul" id="cnfig-mgmt-and-cmdb__ul_utx_l4g_fq">
            <li class="li">A physical entity, such as a computer or router</li>
            <li class="li">A logical entity, such as an instance of a database</li>
            <li class="li">Conceptual, such as a Requisition Service</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="p">In each case, there are attributes about the CI that you want to maintain, and there is
    control you want to have over the CI. There are changes that may need to be made and tracked
    against the CI. Also, a CI does not exist on its own. CIs have dependencies and relationship
    with other CIs. For example, the loss of disk drives may take a database instance down, which
    affects the requisition service that the HR department uses to order equipment for new
    employees.</p>
         <p class="p">It is this relationship data that makes the CMDB a powerful decision support tool.
    Understanding the dependencies and other relationships among your CIs can tell you, for example,
    exactly who and what is affected by the loss of that bank of disk drives. When you find out that
    a router has failed, you will be able to assess the effect of that outage. When you decide to
    upgrade the processor in a server, you can tell who or what will be affected during the
    outage.</p>
         <p class="p">Configuration items differ from environment to environment because each customer has unique
    needs. Details about the exact physical attributes of a computer may be needed by one customer,
    but may represent meaningless data to another. The NOW Platform provides a mechanism to easily
    define new classes of configuration items and new relationships that may exist between CIs. New
    classes can be defined that extend other classes. For example, a laptop class exists that
    extends the computer class. The computer class itself extends the base CI class. Customer class
    extensions are automatically part of the <span class="ph">ServiceNow</span> environment and blend seamlessly
    into the integration points for other ITIL processes.</p>
         <p class="p">You can for example, set the <span class="keyword parmname">Used for</span> attribute in the cmdb_ci_server table to a value such as ‘development’, ‘test’, or ‘production’. These values indicate the environment that the CI is supporting, and
            serve as a way of tracking a CI through its life cycle in a changing environment.</p>

         <p class="p">There are tables that are not part of the CMDB hierarchy but which still qualify as CMDB data.
     <dfn class="term">Related tables</dfn>, such as the Serial Number [cmdb_serial_number] table, don't

         <p class="p">Some scenarios that involve related tables, can result in orphan or otherwise stale records in related tables.

         <p class="p">Using the Translated Text field type (instead of string) for attributes in CMDB tables, can reduce overall  performance, including performance of features such as CMDB Health. This is because
            values in CMDB tables are dynamic and are likely to change often, and the data itself is likely to continuously grow. Using the Translated Text field also requires manual update of related text. The Translated Text field type is
            typically effective with static data that doesn't change and doesn't grow. For more information about field types, see <a data-bundleid="yokohama-servicenow-platform" data-navpath="product/configuration-management/concept//csh" href="/docs/csh?topicname=r_FieldTypes&amp;version=yokohama&amp;pubname=yokohama-platform-administration" class="xref">Field types reference</a>.</p>

         <p class="p">Reading CMDB tables directly requires the cmdb_read role, however accessing the <span class="ph uicontrol">Configuration</span> module requires the asset, itil, or itil_admin roles. For viewing CMDB-related records in the user interface,
            the itil role is usually sufficient. For updating records and for other manipulation of records, roles with higher credentials are usually required, as noted in each procedure throughout the documentation set.</p>
